      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've always had a desire for everything involving computers, graphics, designing, web etc. 
        Always in to the way all of these components worked together and soon found out I really loved it.
        Now I am here with UCF Coding Bootcamp to fulfill my goal!!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from San Juan, Puerto Rico</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My favorite hobbies would have to be going to the beach as often as I can, saltwater reef aquariums, sports cars/races and I also enjoy cooking.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>To me a dream job is doing something you love. I have fulfilled part of it by working in the saltwater reef industry but I also love to create things digitally
        whether it involves graphics, pictures etc. Becoming a Web Developer has always been a passion of mine and something I've always wanted to accomplish.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Orlando, Florida</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It has been a long time passion and goal for myself. I love creating and fixing things and to be able to create a web page and not only see its use online
         but also designing and managing the inner and outer workings of that webpage is what I would enjoy the most</p>
